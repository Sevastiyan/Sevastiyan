### The Challenge: Building a Scalable Sleep Analytics Platform

Wethm's vision was to provide users with real-time, actionable insights into their sleep patterns. This required a backend system that could ingest and process a massive volume of bio-signal data from thousands of mattress sensors concurrently, with near-instantaneous results. The core challenges were ensuring extreme reliability, low-latency processing for a seamless user experience, and designing a data architecture optimized for heavy, time-series-based write loads.

### The Solution: An Event-Driven, Serverless Architecture

I engineered a high-throughput, fault-tolerant data pipeline on AWS. The system was designed to be event-driven and serverless, leveraging AWS Lambda for processing and DynamoDB for storage. This approach ensured that the platform could scale automatically to handle fluctuating loads while maintaining consistent performance and cost-efficiency.

**Key Architectural Features:**

*   **High-Throughput Data Ingestion:** A robust pipeline capable of handling millions of data points per hour without degradation.
*   **AI-Powered Analytics:** Integrated custom AI models for real-time bio-signal analysis, significantly improving the accuracy of sleep pattern and vital sign detection.
*   **Optimized Time-Series Database:** A custom-designed DynamoDB schema built to handle heavy write operations and complex time-series queries efficiently.
